simple-maze-program
===================

a tribute to creating a simple labytienth by using dfs_algorithm. i will fork out another project with this one. in order to use this maze program on your system you will need to install "ncurses" libraries into your linux machine.
to get ncurses enabled on debian based system you can get it simply by entering this in your terminal screen: 
$sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
